## About The Project

This is a Nextjs migration of LoLMH.React. Easier than setting up node or paying for serverless funtions to hide API key + not having to deal with Riot's API CORS shenanigans. Below is the original react project intro.

`A recreation of my vanilla LoLCBL project, minus the CBL part, in React. Its only purpose is to fetch match histories of players across all League of Legends regions with public APIs. This project acts as practice with React, queries, and dynamic cdn asset fetching.`

Now migrated to Nextjs & TypeScript. Functionalities unchanged - prefer keeping it the way it was for posterity, and show growth process.
